# Probability-theory.

## Probability-theory and mathematical statistics.

### Course project:

Task 1. Checking the hypothesis of the Sci-Fi films from IMDB.

Task 2. Predicting the gross by budget and the rating by director name. 

[Link of jypiter.ipynb file these two tasks.](https://github.com/hildar/probability-theory/blob/master/Project_Math_stat_Theory_of_probability.ipynb)
